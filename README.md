This is a project I made for my Highschool Honors Independant Studies Comp Sci Course. It is a TypeRacer Clone App which uses API calls to get a randomized text that the user can type into a text box. If typed accurately it then prints out WPM and Time information. It is currently hosted on github pages on this link: https://dunsink.github.io/TypeRacer/
